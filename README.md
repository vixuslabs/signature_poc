# Mina Digital Signature Issue Reproduction

## Overview
This repository is dedicated to reproducing an issue we have encountered related to digital signatures using the Mina protocol. The core of the issue lies in the verification process of a digital signature generated in Rust and then verified in TypeScript using o1js.

The Rust script uses the `mina-signer` crate to generate a digital signature for an array of u8 numbers, then saves this data along with the associated public key and the base58 encoded signature into a JSON file. The TypeScript script (using the `Signature` class from `o1js`) attempts to verify this signature but fails despite using identical data and public key parameters.

The primary goal here is to reach out to the Mina community for insights or solutions and document any progress or findings related to this issue.

## Repository Structure

- `rust/`: Contains the Rust script for generating the digital signature and exporting the necessary data.
- `o1js/`: Contains the TypeScript script intended to verify the signature generated by the Rust script.

## Issue Description

When attempting to verify a digital signature (using `o1js`) that was generated in Rust (using `mina-signer`), the verification fails. This is puzzling as the data, public key, and signature remain consistent across both implementations.

## Prerequisites

- Rust installation for running Rust scripts.
- Node.js and pnpm for handling JavaScript dependencies and running the TypeScript script.

## Running the Code

### Rust

To generate the digital signature and associated data:

1. Navigate to the `signature_poc/rust` directory.
2. Execute the command:
   ```bash
   cargo run
   ```

This will generate a JSON file containing the signed data, the digital signature, and the public key, and will save it to the `o1js/web` directory.

## o1js
To verify the signature:

1. Ensure you have pnpm installed. If not, you can install it using npm install -g pnpm.
2. Navigate to the `signature_poc/o1js` directory.
3. Install the necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```

4. Run the local development server:

    ```bash
    pnpm vite
    ```
5. Open a browser and navigate to localhost:5173 to execute the TypeScript script.

6. Open the browser's console and check the logs.
